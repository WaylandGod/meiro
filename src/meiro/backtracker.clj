  "The Recursive Backtracker algorithm uses a biased random walk to generate a
  maze. While there are unvisited cells, it chooses one at random, but when it
  encounters a dead end, it backtracks on its path until it finds a cell with
  unvisited neighbors and walks, repeating until all cells have been linked."
